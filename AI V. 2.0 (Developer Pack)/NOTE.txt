Welcome to the V. 2.0 of AI Arduino.

Hello, user. I'm happy to say that the new version of the AI Arduino is released.

The newer version is much faster , accurate , and can recognize your voice better as it uses 'Nural network' to recognize your voice better.

This time we are creating a '.exe' file for the AI, so you need not to install python , dependencies except 1GB free space in your device.
